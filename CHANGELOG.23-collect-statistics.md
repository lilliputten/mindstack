Collect statistics, show statistics (and progress?) info.
23-collect-statistics-show-statistics-and-progress-info

- Created statistics calculation: updated data models, displaying brief statistics in the `WorkoutTopicControl` component, updated inner state management in the `WorkoutQuestionContainer` (it's more relying to the `WorkoutContext` data), refactored `useWorkout` state management (all the methods divided to data-updating and data saving and loading; debug logging is keeping temporarily).
